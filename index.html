        <p>A Russian journalist has died after setting herself on fire in front of the local branch of the interior ministry in the city of Nizhny Novgorod, a day after her apartment was searched by police.</p>
        <p>Prior to her self-immolation, Irina Slavina wrote on her Facebook page: “I ask you to blame the Russian Federation for my death.”</p>
        <p>Slavina worked as editor-in-chief at <a href="https://koza.press/" style="color:#C70000">Koza Press</a>, a small local news outlet that advertised itself as having “no censorship, no orders ‘from above’”.</p>
        <p>A day before her death, she wrote on Facebook that police officers and investigators had searched her apartment, and that they were looking for “brochures, leaflets and accounts” from the Open Russia opposition group, which is financed by the Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky.</p>
        <p>She said they seized notebooks, her laptop and other electronics, as well as her daughter’s laptop and her husband’s mobile phone.</p>
        <p>The Investigative Committee of Russia said it was opening a preliminary investigation after a woman self-immolated in Nizhny Novgorod, a city of 1.3 million about 250 miles (400km) east of Moscow. It did not name Slavina in the statement.</p>
        <p>Members of Russia’s opposition said Slavina had been under pressure from the authorities.</p>
        <p>“Over the past years security officials have subjected her to endless persecution because of her opposition [activities],” the opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov wrote on Instagram.</p>
        <p>“What a nightmare,” Ilya Yashin, another Kremlin critic, wrote on Twitter. “All of these cases of police amusing themselves, these shows of men in masks – these are not games. The government is truly breaking people psychologically.”</p>

            <h2>News is under threat …</h2>
            <p>… just when we need it the most. Millions of readers around the world are flocking to the Guardian in search of honest, authoritative, fact-based reporting that can help them understand the biggest challenge we have faced in our lifetime. But at this crucial moment, news organisations are facing a cruel financial double blow: with fewer people able to leave their homes, and fewer news vendors in operation, we’re seeing a reduction in newspaper sales across the UK. Advertising revenue continues to fall steeply meanwhile as businesses feel the pinch. We need you to help fill the gap.</p> 
            <p>We believe every one of us deserves equal access to vital public service journalism. So, unlike many others, we made a different choice: to keep Guardian journalism open for all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford to pay. This would not be possible without financial contributions from those who can afford to pay, who now support our work from 180 countries around the world.</p>
            <p>Reader financial support has meant we can keep investigating, disentangling and interrogating. It has protected our independence, which has never been so critical. We are so grateful.</p>
            <p>We need your support so we can keep delivering quality journalism that’s open and independent. And that is here for the long term. Every reader contribution, however big or small, is so valuable. <span style="background-color:yellow"><strong>Support The Guardian from as little as £1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.</strong></span></p>
